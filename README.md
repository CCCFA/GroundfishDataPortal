# GroundfishDataPortal
This GitHub details the results of an 18 month effort to document available data and design a New England Groundfish Data Portal, with the primary goal of accommodating the needs of commercial fishermen. Secondary goals included supporting the needs of non-NOAA scientists and groundfish sector managers while building a strong foundation of relationships, solutions and tools, and commitments to change. In the process of designing the data portal, a prototype was developed and piloted with significant documentation and code, to support future efforts to build out a functioning data portal and user interface. Industry user case scenarios were developed to support application design and functionality. 
 
The resources developed through this process are freely and publically available, with the goal that they will be used to improve regional data access.

There are two in-depth documents available to support the Data Portal:

 1: Planning for a New England Groundfish Data Portal (Dec 2021): overview of methodology, blueprint, data sharing levels, future plans, funding resources, and user case scenarios

 2: Data Portal Developer Guide (30 Dec 2021): technical documentation to work with the data portal code and datasets


All of the code and example data are located in the "clean-dash" folder.


Additional pdfs included in the documentation:
